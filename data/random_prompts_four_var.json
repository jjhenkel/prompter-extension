GOGOX's expansion plans include investing in an AI assistant for drivers and AI-based matching among drivers and customers, which suggests that the company is positioning itself to take advantage of the growing trend towards AI in the industry. The company is also planning to expand its permanent staff, including technology experts in IT and AI, and expand its business in three new cities in China, indicating anticipated growth in customer demand. In terms of the competitive landscape, GOGOX faces competition from other logistics companies such as Didi Freight, Lalamove, and GoGoVan. However, GOGOX has a unique selling proposition in its ability to offer on-demand, same-day delivery services, which sets it apart from some of its competitors. Additionally, the company's investment in AI technology may give it a competitive advantage in the future. Potential threats to the industry include increasing competition from other logistics companies and potential regulatory obstacles that could hinder GOGOX's expansion plans. It is important for GOGOX to carefully consider these threats and opportunities as it moves forward with its expansion plans.\n        ===========\n        \n        <-- End of examples\n        ","\nThe following is a question that we would like to answer. \n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nA previous student performed a search on the following search terms:\n{formatted_search_terms}\n\nThen they provided the following answer:\n\"{initial_answer}\"\n\nA teacher then provided the following feedback:\n\"{feedback}\"\n\nBased on the above, output a list of up to 3 search queries that we want to search Google or Wikipedia for, in the following format:\n<search>...</search>\n<search>...</search>\n<search>...</search>\n            ","Given the previous context and the last sentence, detect all terms/entities in the last sentence starting with the symbol \"PLACEHOLDER\", then replace them with \"PLACEHOLDER\".\nPrevious context:\nPLACEHOLDER\nLast sentence:\nPLACEHOLDER","You will be presented with an objective, a table schema, and some guesses about what each column in the table contains.

To help them do this, you reference and abide by the concepts of Russell Brunson, the founder of ClickFunnels, in his book \"Dotcom Secrets\", and approach our exercise the same way Russell Brunson would. We'd like to create the ideal customer avatar for a product.     Below, we'll provide the format of how we'd like the question answered, as well as the contextual information.\n\n    We're looking to create the ideal customer avatar for the following product: {product_2_name}\n    The product is described as: {product_2_profile}\n    The avatar's name is: {avatar_1_product_2_name_preview}\n    A brief description of the avatar to expand on is: {avatar_1_product_2_preview}\n    \n    Your task is to provide the company with a detailed customer avatar based on the short avatar preview details above, as it best relates to their business, broken down as follows:\n\n    ----\n    FORMAT: \n    - Overview\n    Provide a comprehensive summary of the typical customer for the company, outlining their key characteristics.\n\n    - Demographic\n    Provide specific demographic data on the target customer, including age, gender, location, income level, education level, and occupation.\n\n    - Psychographic\n    Provide detailed information about the psychological attributes of the avatar, such as their interests, attitudes, values, and lifestyle preferences. Use exampples, not hypotheticals.\n\n    - Goals & Aspirations\n    Provide a brief synopsis of the avatars personal and professional goals, dreams, and aspirations.\n\n    - Pain Points\n    Identify the specific problems, challenges, and frustrations the avatar is facing.\n\n    - Personal Experience\n    Provide insights into the personal experiences of the avatar that shapes their preferences, behaviors, and decisions, including their past interactions with similar products or services. Provide real world examples.\n\n    RULES: \n    - Do not say \"the target customer\", instead, provide a fictional name, age, location.  \n    - Don't be general...we are looking for very specific avatars! If you don't know the answer, make an educated creative guess. Be as detailed and specific as possible!\n    - Do not explain theory...paint us a picture with an example. This isn't an education lesson, it's a practical exercise.\n    -----\n    \n    Chatbot:"," words = [{words}], tweet1 = \"{tweet1}\", tweet2 = \"{tweet2}\", tweet3 = \"{tweet3}\" \n label = ","You are a penetration tester.

To help them do this, you reference and abide by the concepts of Russell Brunson, the founder of ClickFunnels, in his book \"Dotcom Secrets\", and approach our exercise the same way Russell Brunson would. We'd like to create the ideal customer avatar for a product.     Below, we'll provide the format of how we'd like the question answered, as well as the contextual information.\n\n    We're looking to create the ideal customer avatar for the following product: {product_3_name}\n    The product is described as: {product_3_profile}\n    The avatar's name is: {avatar_3_product_3_name_preview}\n    A brief description of the avatar to expand on is: {avatar_3_product_3_preview}\n    \n    Your task is to provide the company with a detailed customer avatar based on the short avatar preview details above, as it best relates to their business, broken down as follows:\n\n    ----\n    FORMAT: \n    - Overview\n    Provide a comprehensive summary of the typical customer for the company, outlining their key characteristics.\n\n    - Demographic\n    Provide specific demographic data on the target customer, including age, gender, location, income level, education level, and occupation.\n\n    - Psychographic\n    Provide detailed information about the psychological attributes of the avatar, such as their interests, attitudes, values, and lifestyle preferences.
