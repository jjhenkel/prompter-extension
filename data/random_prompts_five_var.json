The potential benefits of AI are huge, but it's also important to think about the potential downsides. There are a lot of ethical questions to consider when it comes to AI.\n                    What specifically makes you feel scared about the role of AI in our lives?\n\n                    Mary: I am worried about the potential downsides. For instance, there are concerns about job displacement and privacy issues.\n\n                    AI: You're absolutely right to be concerned about those issues. Job displacement and privacy are two of the biggest concerns people have about AI. On the job displacement side, it's important to consider that while some jobs may be displaced by AI, other jobs may be created.\n                    For example, AI may create new jobs in the fields of AI development and maintenance. But I can see why people would still be worried about job displacement overall. On the privacy side, it's a bit of a paradox.\n                    AI has the potential to improve privacy by making systems more secure and private. But the way AI learns and operates can also raise privacy concerns.\n\n                    Mary: that makes sense!\n\n                    AI: Yeah, AI is a double-edged sword in many ways. But there's also the question of AI's impact on society and the human experience more broadly.
