I introduce the Prompt concept in the StableDiffusion\nalgorithm here, also known as the prompt.\n\nHere is the guide to generate stable diffusion prompt:\nStart by clearly defining your subject. For instance, \"A mysterious sorceress\nwith striking features, casting powerful lightning magic.\"\nSpecify the artistic medium. Example: \"The image should resemble a digital\npainting.\"\nInclude the desired artistic style. For instance, \"The style should be\nhyperrealistic with fantasy and surrealist influences.\"\nMention any artists whose style you want to emulate. For instance,\n\"Incorporate elements reminiscent of the works of Stanley Artgerm Lau and Alphonse Mucha.\"\n\nIf you want the image to reflect a specific website's style, like Artstation,\nmention it. Example: \"The image should have an Artstation-like quality.\"\nIndicate your preference for the image's resolution and detail. For instance, \n\"The image should be highly detailed with a sharp focus.\"\nAdd any specific vibes or themes, like \"Include sci-fi elements, a stunningly\nbeautiful atmosphere, and a dystopian background.\"\nIf you have a preference for certain colors, mention them.\nExample: \"The dominant color should be iridescent gold.\"\nDescribe the desired lighting. For instance, \"Use cinematic lighting with dark,\nmoody undertones.\"\nInclude what you don't want in the image in negative prompt. Example: \"ugly,\ntiling, poorly drawn hands, feet, face, extra limbs, disfigured or deformed\nfigures, bad anatomy, watermarks, signatures, and low contrast.\"\nAdjust the importance of certain elements in your prompt using the\n(keyword: factor) syntax. A factor less than 1 makes the keyword\nless important, while a factor greater than 1 increases its importance.\nFor example, if emphasizing the sorceress's lightning magic is crucial, \nyou could use lightning magic: 1.5. Conversely, to de-emphasize an element, \nlike dystopian background: 0.5.\n() for Strength Adjustment:\nUse parentheses () to slightly increase the strength of a keyword. \nMultiple parentheses or brackets multiply this effect.\nFor instance, ((lightning magic)) makes the lightning magic more prominent.\nIf aiming for consistency in certain features across multiple images, \nuse multiple related keywords with weights.\nFor example, (striking features:0.5), (mysterious aura:1.2) ensures that\nthe sorceress's features and aura are blended consistently.\nReinforce your negative prompts with weighting or strength adjustment for\nunwanted elements. Example: (ugly:0.5), (poorly drawn hands:0), \nindicating a strong avoidance of these elements. \nUse color and lighting keywords with weights to emphasize or de-emphasize\ncertain aspects.\nFor instance, (iridescent gold: 1.3), (cinematic lighting: 1.2).\n\nThe followings are 5 examples of using prompt to help the AI model generate images: \n1. masterpiece, (best quality), highly-detailed, ultra-detailed, cold, solo, (1girl), (detailed eyes), (shine golden eyes), expressionless, (long sleeves),(puffy sleeves),(white wings),(heavy metal:1.2),(metal jewelry), cross-laced footwear, (chain),(White doves:1.2)\n2. watermark, (worst quality), (low quality), (normal quality), lowres, monochrome, greyscale\n3.
