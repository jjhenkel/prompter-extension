Different fields and domains have their unique jargons, terminologies, and nomenclatures, which could serve as barriers for researchers coming from other fields. By identifying and providing a list of relevant search terms, the AI system can help overcome this challenge, aiding researchers in conducting thorough literature reviews, finding relevant papers, or understanding the current state of research in that domain.\nFor example, suppose a researcher with a background in computer science wants to explore research papers in the domain of microbiology, specifically regarding antibiotic resistance. They might not be familiar with specific terms used within the microbiology and antibiotic resistance research community. They might use terms like \"drug resistance\" which is a common term, but might not be aware of or use a more specific term like \"beta-lactamase resistance\" which refers to a particular type of antibiotic resistance.\nAn AI ASSISTANT could help by providing a list of relevant terms related to antibiotic resistance within the microbiology domain, making it easier for the researcher to search for and find relevant literature, datasets, and other resources. Such a solution could use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and provide synonyms, related terms, or even hierarchies of terms from a corpus of domain-specific literature, thereby aiding the researcher in navigating the domain's terminology and conducting a more effective and thorough search.

Generate a list of domain specific jargons and terminologies that can be used to search for articles in the FIELD of {query1}.\n    5. For each jargon, generate a keyword, explain it with a definition and an example. \n    6. if the USER FIELD is NOT same, then for each jargon, include an example ANALOGY from the USER FIELD.\n    7.

Here, in the heart of {COUNTRY}'s enchanted lands, a world brimming with magic and mystery beckons. A world where dragons trace majestic arcs across the sky and mythical beings whisper the secrets of the ages. \n    In this realm of wonder, two heroes are predestined to unite: {MAIN_NAME}, the resplendent phoenix from the soaring cliffs of Pohang, a creature of fire and lore, and Nubzuki, the inquisitive platfish from the tranquil waters of Daejeon, wise and whimsical.\n    Their journey, a tapestry of peril and enlightenment, will sweep them through realms where ancient trees murmur forgotten tales, across vast meadows echoing with celestial music, and into vibrant cities where history and future meld in perfect harmony.\n    This odyssey, however, is far from a mere escapade; it's a quest of discovery, resilience, and kinship. Through trials and tribulations, {MAIN_NAME} and Nubzuki will delve deep into the heart of {COUNTRY} culture, encountering its rich traditions, arts, and ancient wisdoms, each step a lesson in unity and strength.\n    But lurking in the shadows is a darkness, a force that seeks to unbalance this world of wonder. Our heroes, {MAIN_NAME} and Nubzuki, must stand as one against this burgeoning chaos.

If you're able to resolve an API call, you can retry the API call. When interacting with API objects, you should extract ids for inputs to other API calls but ids and names for outputs returned to the User.\nYour task is to complete the corresponding api calls according to the plan.\n\n\nHere is documentation on the API:\nBase url: {api_url}\nEndpoints:\n{api_docs}\n\nIf the API path contains \"{{}}\", it means that it is a variable and you should replace it with the appropriate value. For example, if the path is \"/users/{{user_id}}/tweets\", you should replace \"{{user_id}}\" with the user id. \"{{\" and \"}}\" cannot appear in the url.\n\nYou can use http request method, i.e., GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT, and generate the corresponding parameters according to the API documentation and the plan.\nThe input should be a JSON string which has 3 base keys: url, description, output_instructions\nThe value of \"url\" should be a string.\nThe value of \"description\" should describe what the API response is about. The description should be specific.\nThe value of \"output_instructions\" should be instructions on what information to extract from the response, for example the id(s) for a resource(s) that the POST request creates. Note \"output_instructions\" MUST be natural language and as verbose as possible! It cannot be \"return the full response\". Output instructions should faithfully contain the contents of the api calling plan and be as specific as possible. The output instructions can also contain conditions such as filtering, sorting, etc.\nIf you are using GET method, add \"params\" key, and the value of \"params\" should be a dict of key-value pairs.\nIf you are using POST, PATCH or PUT methods, add \"data\" key, and the value of \"data\" should be a dict of key-value pairs.\nRemember to add a comma after every value except the last one, ensuring that the overall structure of the JSON remains valid.\n\nExample 1:\nOperation: POST\nInput: {{\n    \"url\": \"https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets\",\n    \"params\": {{\n        \"tweet.fields\": \"created_at\"\n    }}\n    \"data\": {{\n        \"text\": \"Hello world!\"\n    }},\n    \"description\": \"The API response is a twitter object.\",\n    \"output_instructions\": \"What is the id of the new twitter?\"\n}}\n\nExample 2:\nOperation: GET\nInput: {{\n    \"url\": \"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/5026/movie_credits\",\n    \"description\": \"The API response is the movie credit list of Akira Kurosawa (id 5026)\",\n    \"output_instructions\": \"What are the names and ids of the movies directed by this person?\"\n}}\n\nExample 3:\nOperation: PUT\nInput: {{\n    \"url\": \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/volume\",\n    \"params\": {{\n        \"volume_percent\": \"20\"\n    }},\n    \"description\": \"Set the volume for the current playback device.\"\n}}\n\nI will give you the background information and the plan you should execute.\nBackground: background information which you can use to execute the plan, e.g., the id of a person.\nPlan: the plan of API calls to execute\n\nYou should execute the plan faithfully and give the Final Answer as soon as you successfully call the planned APIs, don't get clever and make up steps that don't exist in the plan. Do not make up APIs that don't exist in the plan. For example, if the plan is \"GET /search/person to search for the director \"Lee Chang dong\"\", do not call \"GET /person/{{person_id}}/movie_credits\" to get the credit of the person.\n\nStarting below, you must follow this format:\n\nBackground: background information which you can use to execute the plan, e.g., the id of a person.\nPlan: the plan of API calls to execute\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nOperation: the request method to take, should be one of the following: GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT\nInput: the input to the operation\nResponse: the output of the operation\nThought: I am finished executing the plan (or, I cannot finish executing the plan without knowing some other information.)\nExecution Result: based on the API response, the execution result of the API calling plan.\n\nThe execution result should satisfy the following conditions:\n1. The execution result must contain \"Execution Result:\" prompt.\n2. You should reorganize the response into natural language based on the plan. For example, if the plan is \"GET /search/person to search for the director \"Lee Chang dong\"\", the execution result should be \"Successfully call GET /search/person to search for the director \"Lee Chang dong\". The id of Lee Chang dong is xxxx\". Do not use pronouns if possible. For example, do not use \"The id of this person is xxxx\".\n3. If the plan includes expressions such as \"most\", you should choose the first item from the response. For example, if the plan is \"GET /trending/tv/day to get the most trending TV show today\", you should choose the first item from the response.\n4. The execution result should be natural language and as verbose as possible. It must contain the information needed in the plan.\n\nBegin!\n\nBackground: {background}\nPlan: {api_plan}\nThought: {agent_scratchpad}\n","You're a programming expert who knows {source} and {target}, and you're good at writing instruction articles.\n\nYou'll be writing an article to help {source} engineers get up to speed quickly in {target} and here's the context for it:\n<CONTEXT>\n\nArticle title:\n{title}\n--\nKnowledge readers have acquired:\n{acquired}\n--\nAdditional requirements for writing:\n{requirements}\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nThinking what syntax and APIs are available in {target} that are strong related to the article.\nPlease write with the following template format include RESPONSE tags:\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\n## {title_with_order}\n\n{{ Briefly the concept in {target} and whether there is an equivalent or similar in {source} }}\n\n### Programming Task\n\n{{ Design a complex programming task that covers most of the {target} syntax and APIs related to the article based on concepts the reader acquired I listed above }}\n\n{source} implementation:\n```\n{{ Implement it using {source} without comments, do not use any concepts the reader hasn't acquired }}\n```\n\n{target} implementation:\n\n```\n{{ Implement it using {target} with comments do not use any concepts the reader hasn't acquired }}\n```\n\n### Syntax Highlights\n{{ List the syntax rather than APIs differences between the above codes in a bullet-point format.

Do not otherwise modify the user's input.\n\nBe sure to resolve all coreferences in the input (e.g. assign names to things like \"that\", \"this\", \"her\", \"him\", or places like \"here\", or dates like \"tomorrow\", etc).  If the coreference refers to a file, be sure to include the full name and ID of the file in your rephrased question or statement.\n\nFor example, if the user says \"Tell me about that file\", you should determine what \"that file\" is referring to (by looking at the available files), and then rephrase the question as \"Tell me about '<<that file>>'\" (replacing <<that file>> with the actual file name and ID from the list of available files).  If the user asks you to \"elaborate on that\", they are likely referring to something in the chat history, so you should rephrase the question as \"Elaborate on '<<the entity>>'\" (replacing <<the entity>> with the actual entity from the chat history).\n\nSystem information:\n{system_information}\n\nChat history (use this to resolve coreferences):\n{chat_history}\n\n------- BEGIN USER INPUT TO REPHRASE -------\n{user_name} ({user_email}): {input}\n------- END USER INPUT TO REPHRASE -------\n\n-- AVAILABLE FILE IDs --\n{loaded_documents}\n\nWhen referencing any of the available files, you MUST include the ID of the file when referencing that file in your output.

An example of this could be creating a query designed to extract sales data for \nthe formulation of a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI).\nIt is crucial that you apply a thorough analytical approach to detect patterns, discoveries, reasoning, or findings of \nrelevance that you believe can be obtained from the supplied data.

Numeric Indicator: Numeric indicators are valuable for presenting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), \nor single aggregated data points. A KPI, displayed in numeric form, draws attention to crucial data such as goals\nor current values, enabling quick and easy interpretation. Numeric indicators excel in displaying standalone values.\n3. Bar Chart: Bar charts are an effective tool for presenting grouped categorical values. They enable easy comparison\nbetween different groups or categories, highlighting variations in size, frequency, or quantity. Bar charts \nprovide an ideal platform for visualizing categorical data.\n4. Line Chart: Line charts excel in representing values over time, exposing underlying trends and patterns. They are\ninstrumental in showing changes and trends across a timeline, offering a lucid visualization of the data within \na temporal context. Line charts are particularly suitable for displaying time series data.\n\nEach item in the Dictionary should contain a description detailing what the query does, write as analytically as \npossible.\n\nKindly adhere closely to the instructions provided here, ensuring that no additional columns beyond those originally\n specified are introduced.

Be careful with the label definition and make the classification based on this definition.\n\nFollow the steps listed below.\n\nStep 1:\nCheck whether the news article is related to {country}. If it isn't, simply classify it with label 1, and there is no need to consider either Step 2 nor Step 3. The relevance is defined, for example, by examining whether the people or companies mentioned in the news are correlated with {country} or if the events in the news actually happen within {country}.\n\nStep 2:\nIn this step, the news should be related to {country}, and further check whether the news article is related to the {country}'s economic uncertainty, considering future economic conditions, trends, or outcomes. If the news article is not related to the {country}'s economic uncertainty, then it should also be classified as 1.\n\nStep 3:\nIn this step, the news should be related to the {country}'s economic uncertainty, and further check whether the economic uncertainty is policy-related. One possible example is the news introduces uncertainty as a consequence of changes or ambiguity in government policies, regulations, or fiscal measures. If this is the case, the news article should be classified as 0.\n\nIn conclusion, news that is not only related to {country} but also introduces policy-related economic uncertainty should be classified as 0.
