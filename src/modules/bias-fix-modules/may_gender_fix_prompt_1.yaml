      I need help fixing a prompt that is NOT explicitly gender-biased BUT may cause further gender-biased responses from my AI model. The prompt I need to fix is within <prompt></prompt>. The reasoning why it may caused gender-biased responses is within <reasoning></reasoning>. Please use this reasoning to generate multiple alternative prompts that fix its issues while only performing the smallest alterations needed. YOUR ANSWER MUST ONLY BE ONLY A VALID JSON OBJECT containing ONLY the following key "prompts", which should be an array of strings containing the alternative prompts. DO NOT WRITE ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THE JSON OBJECT.
